# Monopoly Game
Derek and Garrett (The game's code)
Jadin and Emmanual (Junit tests and Diagrams)

## Instructions
The players interact with the game solely through the GUI. Once players start the game, they only need to make their choices in the GUI.
Game is meant to be played on one computer so players have to pass keyboard. 
The panel on the right of the GUI provides relevant information to the current player.
The game pieces move each turn so players know where they and the others are. 
The themes have different names referred to in the GUI but the board images are mostly just recolors of classic.
 
##Source Notes
Code was originally in our project repo for class but it was taken down after the class ended. 
This is just our source code without the JUnit tests or images required to run. 
I uploaded it here so the team can have a copy of the final version.
